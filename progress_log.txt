Mon 6.3.

I have added the DashboardApp and APIConnection classes (and DataSource class without implementation).
In the DashboardApp class, I have implemented the basic GUI layout without any functionality yet.
In the APIConnection class, I have implemented methods for fetching data from the API in a string format.

I haven't written any tests for methods yet, but I have tested the APIConnection.fetch method in REPL.

I faced some difficulties when adding library dependencies for making GET requests to the API, but managed to solve that.

I have spent a lot of time on getting familiar with ScalaFX, GET requests and the API documentation, which were new topics for me.
In total, I have spent about 15 hours on the project.

I'm roughly at the same stage as I had planned.

I have implemented two new classes: LeagueData and ChartBox.

The ChartBox class represents chart boxes that are added to the chart area in GUI. The chart boxes have adjustable sizes.
I also changed the layout of the chart area from GridPane to FlowPane because it made the GUI more flexible.

The LeagueData class has a getLeagueData method which uses the decodeTeams method in APIConnection class to retrieve data from the API.
The data is stored in a case class where it can be easily accessed by other classes

I also implemented some tests for the LeagueData class, but they are not very comprehensive yet.
I have tested the GUI just by using it.

I had some problems with implementing the chart boxes and how to make them adjustable but the work quite well at the moment.
I also used a lot of time to think how to make the GUI layout user-friendly.

In total, I have spent about 15 hours on the project during the last two weeks.

I'm a bit behind the stage I had planned.

Mon 3.4.

During the last two weeks, I have worked mainly on improving the GUI.

I have implemented methods for selecting data and charts. At the moment, the charts have just some test data. My next task is to connect
the charts with the selected data. The method for selecting club is the first one in the GUI that uses the APIConnection class to fetch
data from the API. For now, the data is just a list of clubs in the selected league, but fetching more complex data shouldn't be very
difficult to implement, now that I know the basics of fetching data and connecting it to the GUI.

I haven't written any new tests, but I have used the GUI in different scenarios.

The GUI has few little bugs that I'm working on. But nothing unreasonably difficult has occured.

In total, I have spent about 15 hours on the project during the last two weeks.

I'm a bit behind the stage I had planned.

Mon 17.4.

During the last two weeks, I have worked on adding the selected data to charts.

I created a new clubData object, which fetches club statistics from the API. I also added a trait class for charts to update the data
and title in different charts. In general, the dashboard works ok, and it can be used to display and compare different kinds of football
data.

The project is still lacking a lot of features I had planned and I won't have time to implement all of them. However, I should be able to
implement the moderate project requirements, like loading and saving the dashboard to files, and adding cards to the dashboard.

I have only written one new test for checking if fetching club data from the API works properly. I have also tested the GUI by hand in
different scenarios.

I had some problems with the JSON that was returned from the API, because it had words like "for" and numbers as object names. I also
had to do some things in the GUI in a more difficult way than I would have wanted, because ScalaFX wasn't working as I intended.

In total, I have spent about 20 hours on the project during the last two weeks.

I'm a bit behind the stage I had planned.
