Mon 6.3.

I have added the DashboardApp and APIConnection classes (and DataSource class without implementation).
In the DashboardApp class, I have implemented the basic GUI layout without any functionality yet.
In the APIConnection class, I have implemented methods for fetching data from the API in a string format.

I haven't written any tests for methods yet, but I have tested the APIConnection.fetch method in REPL.

I faced some difficulties when adding library dependencies for making GET requests to the API, but managed to solve that.

I have spent a lot of time on getting familiar with ScalaFX, GET requests and the API documentation, which were new topics for me.
In total, I have spent about 15 hours on the project.

I'm roughly at the same stage as I had planned.

Mon 20.3.

I have implemented two new classes: LeagueData and ChartBox.

The ChartBox class represents chart boxes that are added to the chart area in GUI. The chart boxes have adjustable sizes.
I also changed the layout of the chart area from GridPane to FlowPane because it made the GUI more flexible.

The LeagueData class has a getLeagueData method which uses the decodeTeams method in APIConnection class to retrieve data from the API.
The data is stored in a case class where it can be easily accessed by other classes

I also implemented some tests for the LeagueData class, but they are not very comprehensive yet.
I have tested the GUI just by using it.

I had some problems with implementing the chart boxes and how to make them adjustable but the work quite well at the moment.
I also used a lot of time to think how to make the GUI layout user-friendly.

In total, I have spent about 15 hours on the project during the last two weeks.

I'm a bit behind the stage I had planned.
