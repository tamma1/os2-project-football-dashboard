Mon 6.3.

I have added the DashboardApp and APIConnection classes (and DataSource class without implementation).
In the DashboardApp class, I have implemented the basic GUI layout without any functionality yet.
In the APIConnection class, I have implemented methods for fetching data from the API in a string format.

I haven't written any tests for methods yet, but I have tested the APIConnection.fetch method in REPL.

I faced some difficulties when adding library dependencies for making GET requests to the API, but managed to solve that.

I have spent a lot of time on getting familiar with ScalaFX, GET requests and the API documentation, which were new topics for me.
In total, I have spent about 15 hours on the project.

I'm roughly at the same stage as I had planned.
